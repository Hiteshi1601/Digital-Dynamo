Abstract :

 MediQR – Health in a Scan, our solution for transforming emergency healthcare. Imagine a world where a single QR code gives doctors instant access to your medical history, prescriptions, allergies, and even live blood bank availability. MediQR makes that possible. It’s fast, secure, and life-saving—especially in critical moments when every second counts.Our system integrates cloud-based AI with encrypted databases, ensuring both accuracy and privacy. Whether you're unconscious in an emergency or just visiting a new clinic, MediQR bridges the gap between patients and providers. It’s not just a tool—it’s a leap toward smarter, safer, and more connected healthcare.In emergencies, time is everything. A delay of even a few minutes can mean the difference between life and death. Yet, in most hospitals, doctors still rely on paper records, verbal histories, or fragmented digital systems. MediQR changes that.Our system creates a digital health profile linked to a unique QR code. When scanned, it reveals a patient’s medical history, current health issues, prescriptions, allergies, and even live blood bank availability. No login. No delay. Just life-saving data—instantly.But MediQR isn’t just for emergencies. It’s a complete health ecosystem. Patients can update their prescriptions, track dosage schedules, and share their profile with any hospital or clinic. Doctors can verify drug interactions using our AI-powered backend. Blood banks can match donors in real time. And in disaster zones or rural areas, our offline mode ensures access even without internet.Technically, MediQR is built for scale and security. Our cloud-based encrypted database ensures privacy. The mobile app and hospital portal are intuitive and fast. And our emergency dashboard is designed to work across devices and platforms.
